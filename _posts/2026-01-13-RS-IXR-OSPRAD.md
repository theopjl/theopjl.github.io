### GitHub repository link

You can find the repository source **[here.](https://github.com/theopjl/OSpRad-Refactor)**

## Background and Motivation

This project builds upon the excellent work done by the **[OSpRad project](https://github.com/troscianko/OSpRad)**, an open-source spectroradiometer designed for accessible and accurate light measurement in research and fieldwork.

The original OSpRad Python application provided essential functionality for radiance and irradiance measurements, but was designed as a monolithic application. This refactor reimagines the codebase with modern software engineering practices to make it more maintainable, extensible, and suitable for broader educational and research applications.

## Refactor Summary

### What Changed

This implementation represents a ground-up architectural refactor with the following key improvements:

**Modular Architecture**
- Separated device communication, calibration logic, and GUI into distinct, reusable modules
- Introduced abstract device interface (`SpectralDevice`) enabling support for multiple device types
- Clean separation of concerns between hardware I/O, data processing, and presentation layers

**Code Quality & Maintainability**
- Type hints throughout for better IDE support and error detection
- Comprehensive docstrings for all public methods and classes
- Eliminated code duplication through proper class hierarchies
- Structured constants and configuration in dedicated sections
- Improved error handling with clear status reporting

**Enhanced Usability**
- Modern tkinter-based GUI with real-time plotting
- Settings panel with dynamic controls based on device capabilities
- Better visual feedback during measurements
- Export functionality for data preservation
- Responsive layout suitable for various screen sizes

**Extensibility**
- Plugin-style device architecture - add new devices by implementing `SpectralDevice` interface
- Easy to extend with new measurement types or analysis features
- Platform-agnostic design (supports both desktop and Android via conditional imports)

### Goals Achieved

✅ **Simpler, more readable code** - Logical module organization, clear naming conventions  
✅ **Easier maintenance and testing** - Isolated components, reduced coupling  
✅ **Modular UI/UX design** - Pluggable GUI components, reusable widgets  
✅ **Open-source and device-agnostic** - Abstract interfaces enable multi-device support  
✅ **Research & education ready** - Well-documented, examples included, suitable for teaching

## Usage

### Basic Programmatic Usage

```python
from spectral_gui.devices import OSpRadDevice
from spectral_gui.core.device_interface import MeasurementType

# Initialize device with calibration file
device = OSpRadDevice(calibration_file="calibration_data.csv")

# Connect to hardware
if device.connect():
    print(f"Connected: {device.get_capabilities().device_name}")
    
    # Configure measurement settings
    device.configure({
        'integration_time': 0,      # Auto-integration
        'min_scans': 3,
        'max_scans': 50
    })
    
    # Perform radiance measurement
    result = device.measure(MeasurementType.RADIANCE)
    
    if result:
        print(f"Luminance: {result.luminance:.2f} cd/m²")
        print(f"Integration time: {result.integration_time_ms} ms")
        print(f"Scans averaged: {result.num_scans}")
        print(f"Wavelengths: {len(result.wavelengths)} pixels")
        
        # Access spectral data
        for wl, intensity in zip(result.wavelengths, result.spectral_data):
            print(f"{wl:.1f} nm: {intensity:.6e} W/(sr·m²·nm)")
    
    device.disconnect()
else:
    print("Connection failed:", device.get_error())
```

### GUI Application

Run the complete GUI application:

```bash
python spectral_gui/main.py
```

The GUI provides:
- **Connection panel** - Connect/disconnect with status indicators
- **Settings panel** - Dynamic controls for device-specific parameters
- **Measurement buttons** - Trigger radiance or irradiance measurements
- **Live plotting** - Real-time spectral distribution visualization
- **Results display** - Photometric values, metadata, saturation warnings
- **Export options** - Save data in CSV or JSON formats

## Calibration

### Calibration File Format

The OSpRad requires a CSV calibration file (`calibration_data.csv`) with the following structure:

```csv
<unit_number>,wavCoef,<coef0>,<coef1>,<coef2>,<coef3>,<coef4>,<coef5>
<unit_number>,radSens,<sens_0>,<sens_1>,...,<sens_287>
<unit_number>,irrSens,<sens_0>,<sens_1>,...,<sens_287>
<unit_number>,linCoefs,<coef0>,<coef1>
```

- **wavCoef**: Polynomial coefficients for wavelength calculation (6 coefficients)
- **radSens**: Radiance sensitivity per pixel (288 values, W/(sr·m²·nm) per count)
- **irrSens**: Irradiance sensitivity per pixel (288 values, W/(m²·nm) per count)
- **linCoefs**: Linearity correction coefficients (2 values)

### Loading Behavior

1. **Auto-detection**: On first measurement, device reads unit number from hardware response
2. **Dynamic loading**: `OSpRadCalibration.load_for_unit()` searches CSV for matching unit number
3. **Validation**: Verifies all required arrays have correct lengths (288 pixels, 6 wavCoef, etc.)
4. **Derived values**: Automatically computes:
   - Wavelength array from polynomial coefficients
   - Wavelength bin widths for integration
   - CIE photopic response curve (Y values) for luminance calculation

### File Placement

Place `calibration_data.csv` in:
- **Project root** (next to `spectral_gui/`) for default behavior
- **Custom location** by passing `calibration_file="path/to/file.csv"` to `OSpRadDevice()`

---

## Development

### Adding a New Device

1. Create a new file in `spectral_gui/devices/` (e.g., `mydevice.py`)
2. Subclass `SpectralDevice` from `core.device_interface`
3. Implement required methods: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `measure()`, `get_capabilities()`, `configure()`
4. Register device in `spectral_gui/__init__.py`
5. Use `device_template.py` as a reference

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run with mock device (no hardware required)
python spectral_gui/main.py --device mock

# Test connection only
python -c "from spectral_gui.devices import OSpRadDevice; d = OSpRadDevice(); print('OK' if d.connect() else 'FAIL')"
```

### Code Style

- **PEP 8** compliant
- Type hints for all public APIs
- Docstrings in Google style
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
